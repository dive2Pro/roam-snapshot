# Page History
The `Page history` feature lets you see all changes made to a page, when. You can view and restore past versions of any Roam page going back indefinitely.



## Access page history

- Click the ••• menu at the top right of any Roam page. Choose Page history.

- This opens the Page history window, which enables you to:
  - See all past versions of the current page in a list down the right-hand side. (Every change made to a page creates a separate snapshot.)
  - Click on any past version to see what the page looked like at that point in time and difference with its prev version.

Note: Here's how page history functions!


If you are **actively editing** a page, a snapshot of the current version of the page will be captured every **ten minutes** (You can change it in settings panel).

## Restore past page history snapshots

- You can restore an entire past version so it becomes your current version of the page.
